# Chat

To start the application, run

```bash
$ mix run -e Chat.start
```

## What is this?

A terminal-based chat app that demos the "raw mode" coming to OTP 28. Thanks to @zachallaun for the awesome [writeup](https://elixirforum.com/t/raw-terminal-mode-coming-to-otp-28/67491). He sums it up best:

> If youâ€™re unfamiliar with raw mode, the gist of it is that it allows terminals to read input without waiting for a newline, allowing for much more responsive terminal UIs.

Note that you need to have OTP 28 installed locally, or else the app won't run as expected. For the `asdf` version manager, I installed and activated it via:

```bash
$ asdf install erlang ref:master
$ asdf global erlang ref:master
```
